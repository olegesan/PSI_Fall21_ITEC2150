Welcome to midterm review practice.

I tried to guess what will be in the files for midterm and
added a little cherry on top of it to challenge you just a bit.


First of all, look at Character package.
1. Look at AnimeCharacter class.
2. Look at CharacterTester class. See the order of constructor parameters.
3. Uncomment Commoner and Mage (I had to comment them to allow package compile and run).
4. Implement Commoner and Mage classes to match skeleton. Some methods were implemented for you already.
5. Try to have to charters and adjust code to allow them fighting.
