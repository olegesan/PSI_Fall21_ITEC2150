Welcome to midterm review practice.

Midterm will cover lots of inheritance;so, lets practice it with the characters from Avatar the Last AIr Bender

1. Look at Human class.
2. Look at Bender abstract class.
What is unique about it? What does abstract mean? What method will sub classes have to implement?
3. Look at fire bender class.
What class does it inherit from? How did you see it?
What method did we have to override? What method did we choose to override?
4. Run the Avatar tester class. It has all things supplied for a fun battle.
    Do not worry about random method and fight method for now
5. Implement AirBender, EarthBender, and WaterBender classes.
No need to make a lot of parameters or write getters and setters
But try to understand the line of inheritance
6. In tester class, add more characters and put the to a battle
6.* if you can, make them battle till their stamina goes to 0. You can edit tester as well as any other class
